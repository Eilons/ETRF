# Entity-Based-Relevance-Feedback-for-Document-Retrieval
The annotated dataset, corpus statistics and the initially retrieved document lists used in the paper Entity-Based Relevance Feedback for Document Retrieval

Using crowdsourcing we collected term and entity relevance feedback for ROBUST and ClueWeb datasets. The resultant annotated dataset is the largest reported in the literature for term relevance feedback, and the first for entity relevance feedback, to the best of our knowledge. We published our annotated dataset, corpus entity statistics and the initial document list for further academic use.
